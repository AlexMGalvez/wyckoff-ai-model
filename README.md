# Wyckoff AI Model

> This is a machine learning model for time series pattern recognition using a recurrent neural network and LSTM in TensorFlow.js

## General Info
This time series pattern recognition model specifically identifies the probability that a validation set of stock data meets the characteristics of a Wyckoff accumulation pattern. The gathering of training data is an on going work in progress, and the layers and neurons have yet to be fully optimized.

## Instructions
Download project, open in an IDE, run the local development server with 'npm run start', open home.ejs in a browser.

## Technologies
* Node.js - version 16.14.0
* Tensorflow.js - version 2.0.0

## Features
This model includes:
* Tensor padding and masking function for irregular sized data
* One reccurent layer with LSTM cells
